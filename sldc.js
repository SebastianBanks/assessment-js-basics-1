// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the secound step, where the team will research on what they need to do to understand their problems and answer any questions that may arise. There is usually no building at this stage."
const design = "This is the third step, where the team will design solutions with the research they did in the last step. This is where the team would peer review their soulutions and create documentation for each requirment that they have."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, where they actually build the product. This phase should be the shortest since they should have already had all the research and designs figured out."
const testingAndIntergration = "This is the fifth step, where the developers would create unit test to make sure their product is stable for customers. They may also have beta test versions to find any bugs that they may have missed and to test drive the stability of the product."
const maintain = "This is the last step, where the developers keep the code updated and future-proof as technology changes around them. If any problems show up the developers will release a patch for their product to keep an ideal customer experiance"
